<h1>Education</h1>
<p>Now, of course, my sister <i>just</i> graduated from high school--she is in the midst of her freshman year of ocllege, now. As much stress as it is, she's actually quite enjoying her time there!
<br>
<br>
As a student at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois--a suburb right outside of Chicago--my sister gets to enjoy all the luxuries of being nice and far away from her family--as well as all of the tribulations that come with that amount of responsibility. 
<br>
<br>
Although she was never the sciency-child, my sister is currently majoring in biology on a pre-med tract. Ah, yes. She decided to go to the most expensive school, the only one who gave her <i>zero</i> scholarship money, and decided to do a major that would require her to go to medical school <i>after</i> her expensive undergraduate. As you can tell, my sister is amazing with money.
<br>

<br>
But, in her defense, although she hates most of her classes, she does enjoy one in particular: psychology.
<br>
<br>
In high school, psychology was actually one of her favorite classes that she had ever taken. She was just absolutely fascinated by the way that the brain works and thinks--so much so that when she had the chance to take a class for it while attending university, she jumped at the opportunity. She now has even declared a minor in psychology!
<br>
<br>
As you can probably infer, Mia is incredibly passionate about psychological sciences. Back in high school when she was taking the class, she would analyze us and observe us all at the dinner table. She wouldn't even try to hide it--she would just sit quietly and... watch... Not gonna lie, it was low-key <i>kind of</i> creepy. But hey, at least she was enjoying herself... in a totally not-peculiar, not-stalkerish way, I guess...
<br>
<br>
While she <i>is</i> living it up in the windy city, the food at Northwestern isn't to Mia's liking. According to her, it's not very healthy--nor does it taste very good--and she prefers to eat clean. She's been spending all her money at local cafes and salad bars and health-food markets all around Evanston--but hey, it at least saves us money from having to deal with a meal plan! 
<br>
<br>
Ever since they came back from the 2021-2022 Christmas vacation, though, COVID-19 cases have <i>skyrocketed</i> in Evanston, forcing the school to shut down and go virtual. Since reserving a spot at the on-campus gym is too much work for my hardworking-yet-somehow-still-lazy-as-heck older sister, she and her at-school best friend have decided to get a temporary membership at a local gym in Evanston, instead. That way, they can still work out and take their time and not be limited to the forty-five-minute reservation slots of the on-campus gym. 
<br>
<br>
Although her university life is <i>quite</i> intriguing, it's important that we not forget about her high school life, as well. Believe it or not, my astute older sister absolutely <i>hated</i> high school. She did extremely well in all of her classes, but that doesn't mean that she necessarily <i>enjoyed</i> them--well, except for psychology, of course. However, she did have running to keep her sane. But that's a conversation for <a href="running.html">another page</a>. 
<br>
<br>
Even though my sister wasn't the top of her class, she was still pretty up there. She had to work hard to get her grades, though, and she still does. Like she did in high school, she spends a lot of her freetime--if not <i>most</i> of her free time studying--it's quite unfortunate, really. Since she didn't learn much during online school, she is missing a lot of the vital skills she needs for all of her classes. Thus, she is forced to resort to teaching herself the missing material, whilst also studying the material that she is currently learning in all of her classes. For example, currently she is teaching herself trigonometry--my parents are going to get her a tutor, though, so that way her life will be a lot easier and she can actually enjoy her college life instead of just studying all the time.
