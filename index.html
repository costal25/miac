   <h1>Welcome!</h1>
   <p>My lovely, older sister, Mia, is a great addition to my family. Some of you upperclassmen may know her, perhaps as "Mia Pasta" or any other variant of Italian food--how ironic that she now can no longer eat pasta unless it is gluten free.

    I hope to find you all well and safe in these trying times. As someone who is quite terrible at dealing with stress, I vote we delve into the life of someone else who has been plagued with stress in these past couple years with the pandemic and all that mess--since why deal with our own stress when we can observe someone else's?

  Now, of course, my sister's life is not <i>all</i> stress--there are quite a few wonderful parts of her <a id="index-link-1" href="2-daily-life.html">daily life</a> that are quite pleasant and nothing short of intriguing. I think that it's safe to say that she has such an interesting life that one could make a thousand documentaries about her! Howewver, since I am lazy, I will just be coding this website instead.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  As wonderful as it would be if my sister still went to WHS, I think it is safe to say that she has moved on as an alumni. Granted, whenever she comes back to Massachusetts and we drive past the high school, she gets a bit of PTSD from her time here, but hey, don't we all have that one traumatic era during our studies? Either way, her current <a href="3-education.html">education</a> at Northwestern is proving to be a much more suitable environment for my sister.
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  Now, here's a fun fact--did you know that Mia likes to run? Like, <i>really</i> likes to run--it's a bit absurd. I personally think that if it weren't for her unhealthy infatuation with the world of medicine and mathematics she would be running 24/7/365. But either way, she is the epitome of "she's a runner, she's a track star", because she truly <i>is</i> a track star. You can see all kinds of awards and things from her <a href="4-running.html">running career</a> if you pay a little visit to WHS.
  <br>

  If I've got you hooked, but you don't feel like reading and/or you just want to see pictures of the magnificent Mia Pasta--who is allergic to gluten, I have a little <a href="5-gallery.html">gallery</a> page for you. Happy viewing! Please enjoy this little introduction into my sister's life, and stay safe! :)
