    <h3>Fun facts!</h3>
    <!--fun facts, have in a separate element and float it somewhere-->
    <p>Here are some of her favorite foods:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Cauliflower. My sister has an unhealthy obsession with it, and it's getting out of hand. It's actually quite worrying! D:</li>
      <li>Mia <i>loves</i>pasta. I guess that's why they call her <i>Mia Pasta</i>, eh? [bah-dum tsss]. 'Tis a shame that gluten makes her stomach upset. Hey, man, her stomach has feelings too! Maybe gluten just offends it, I don't know!</li>
      <li>Ceasar Salad. 'Nuff said.</li>
      <li>Grilled chicken, which of course <i>always</i> needs to be on her Ceasar salads.</li>
    </ul>

  <p>Ever wondered what it's like to be my sister? I bet you didn't, but I'm going to tell you anyway. Her day starts off simply like this: she wakes up, probably to the sound of me obnoxiously playing my flute in a futile attemp to rid her of her luxurious slumber--just kidding! That's only for holidays because I have the personality of a two-year-old.

    What? What's that? This page is "<i>daily life</i>" not "a day in the life"? Well, by golly, my apologies. Anyways, since we're already here, I'm sure you can assume my sister doesn't sleep all day--because she only does that on Saturdays. 
    <br>
    <br>
    Every other day of the week, she is just like any other young adult; going to work, hanging out with her friends and lovely boyfriend, Shane, and dealing with all of my BS. As the youngest sibling, and the youngest in my family, it is my obligation to be as annoying as physically possible without completely decimating my relatives' egos--not yet, at least. Either way, my sister's life isn't all sleep, I promise.
    <br>
    <br>
    First off, her job is pretty interesting. My dad knows this guy, Matt, who owns a restaurant. Matt's dad also owned the restaurant, along with the help of his grandma. As you can tell, this place is an <i>institution</i>! My dad and Matt used to always go back to Matt's restaurant after baseball games to sneak in the back after hours and get meatball subs and pizza, back when his dad used to own it. Now, since we have... <i>connections</i>, if you will, Mia works there! She is their hostess and busgirl and is one of their most prized workers. this comes from her perfectionist qualities and obsession with making sure that everything goes right and is perfect. 10/10 busgirl material right there.
    <br>
    <br>
    Of course, my sister doesn't work 24/7/365--she only has four-ish hour shifts in the evenings. So what does she do in her free-time? Well, keeping on the topic of food, my lovely sister quite enjoys baking. Baking out of happiness, baking out of sadness, baking out of anger--in which she beats the eggs with vengence, baking out of stress, baking out of basically any other emotion--she just bakes. It's obsessive, but I'm nbot complaining, because she makes some pretty great stuff. 
    <br>

    <br>
    <br>
    Whenever my sister isn't stress-baking because university has been hard, my sister is probably out running. Of course, though, her <a href="4-running.html">running career</a> has been a pretty significant part of her life, so it gets its own page.
    
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    If she isn't running, baking, working, and/or doing math because she is insane and does that to relax herself, she's probably hanging out with her friends or her boyfriend. Her friends are great, but her boyfriend will always reign superior in my opinion. As an old friend from highschool running programs and one of the best friends of her psycho ex, Shane is gloriously and probably shall forever be connected to Mia. They get along great and both have a complete lack of common sense--it's safe to say that both of them are really smart but also incredibly dumb at the same time. Although, I think Shane takes the cake--it's very difficult to light your fish tank on fire, but somehow he managed to do so. But that's okay. It happens to the best of us.
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    But other than that, her life is actually pretty normal. She just chills out and does whatever she does as a legal adult--even though she and I both are basically two-year-olds in teenage bodies--and continues her <a href="3-education.html">studies</a> as an undergrad student.
