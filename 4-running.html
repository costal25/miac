<h1>Running Career</h1>
<p>
  Mia is <i>really</i> good at running--she’s incredibly speedy! When she runs past you, she’s so fast that she experiences the doppler effect. It’s a little scary, really, who wants to be trampled by a muscular human being hurtling towards them at over twelve miles per hour?! Sounds traumatizing to me.

<p>
But, likewise, it’s still incredibly fun to watch her run. Personally, track and field is more pleasant for me to watch than cross country, but alas, we all have our preferences. During her high school career, my sister <i>much</i> preferred track over cross country, as well. Sure, cross country <i>is</i> fun and all, but track is <i>really</i> where it’s at.
<br>
<br>
My sister was never one for field events when she did track. She always stuck to running, since she did cross country, as well. Also, because she lives and breathes running. In middle school, she played three sports: cross country, soccer, and lacrosse--all the running back-and-forth in soccer and lacrosse probably is what brought her her immense speed, and when it was combined with the proper skill-building and training in cross country, she became a <i>machine</i>.</p>
<!--fun facts down here, float them somewhere-->
<div class="fun-run">
  <h3>Fun facts!</h3>
  <p>Here are some fun facts:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Mia’s personal record for the mile race is 5:07. She is speed in a nutshell.</li>
    <li>She went to nationals twice, both times for her 4x800m relay team. Woo!</li>
    <li>At a meet in Falmouth, Massachusetts over the summer, Mia met Molly Seidel, an olympic marathoner. </li>
    <li>Her favorite track event is the 1000m race--also known as a 1k. It’s kind of a weird race, though, 5 laps around a 200m track and 2.5 around a 400m track. Ew.
    </li>
  </ul>
  </div>
<p>
But pshhh, who likes soccer and lacrosse, anyway? Not Mia! As soon as she got to high school, she went right on ahead and quit those two sports, shifting her main focus to cross country and track and field. Good decision on her part, in my personal opinion.
<br>
<br>
Of course, going to all of her cross country meets were fun, but most of the time, they were just completely unpleasant. It was always cold, wet, and gross. Most of her postseason meets were in the snow! However, although winter track in the Reggie Lewis Center always gave me the Reggie Cough--which I still get today since I do track and the air quality in that place is <i>still</i> terrible, it was always my favorite season to watch. Spring was also pretty nice, but it was always smoldering hot and very uncomfortable. 0/10, not fun.

<br>
My sister is very stubborn--she doesn’t let anything hold her back. Sure, that meant that it would make her force herself to run through pain and injuries--resulting in around five stress fractures over the course of four years. But, it also meant that she was incredibly motivated to do good in running, no matter the circumstances. Rain? Not a problem, just wear the non-slippery sneakers. Snow? Of course! Just add an extra layer. Pain? What pain? I don’t feel it. Some would call her obstinate, but I call her resilient. Nothing--and I mean <i>nothing</i> can stop her.
